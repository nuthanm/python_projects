# Project: BMI

#### BMI stands for <mark>_**Body Mass Index**_</mark>
#### It is a measure of body fatness calculated using an individual's weight and height.

#### Here's the formula for calculating BMI:
```

BMI = weight (kg) / height² (m²)

```
where <mark>_**m**_</mark> is meters and <mark>_**kg**_</mark> is kilo grams
