# Project: BMI

#### BMI stands for <mark>_**Body Mass Index**_</mark>
#### It is a measure of body fatness calculated using an individual's weight and height.

#### Here's the formula for calculating BMI:
```

BMI = weight (kg) / height² (m²)

```
where <mark>_**m**_</mark> is meters and <mark>_**kg**_</mark> is kilo grams

If you know Centimeters but don't know what is the equal value in meters,

The formula for converting centimeters to meters:
```
meters = centimeters / 100

```

**Example:** Convert 176 centimeters to meters
```
meters = 176/100 = 1.76

```

**Example:**
For example, if you weigh 75 kg and are 1.76 meters tall, your BMI would be calculated as follows:

BMI = 75/1.76 <sup>2</sup> this gives the result as ```24.22```

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), BMI values are interpreted as follows:

- Less than 18.5: Underweight
- 18.5 to 24.9: Normal weight
- 25 to 29.9: Overweight
- 30 or more: Obese

In this project, we developed using _**Flask**_ web framework to develop.

**Prerequisites:**
- Flask web framework to install: Command: ``` pip install flask ```

**Note:** For all projects, **Python** library is mandatory
