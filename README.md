# Python Projects
You can find several projects where we developed and tested using Python and supported libraries in this repository.
We are going to keep detailed information about each project maintained in the form of the following structure.
- **Folder Name**: Project Name
  - **ReadMe.md File**: Here we give information about the project, prerequisites like libraries, and many more we used.
  - **Folder**: Project files
